# bonbouton
## summary
Bonbouton is a cutting-edge health and technology company that ensures people stay healthy and puts the power back into their hands (and feet). Our first product, a smart insole, detects early signs of foot ulcers before they form so people living with diabetes can access preventative healthcare and confidently manage their health. print graphene into wearables and use that to sense. spoke with someone from product, they're mostly a graphene company, but don't have anything graphene related yet. they're looking at other alternatives for measuring temperature right now, and have embedded twelve different chips into shoe soles. landed on preventing foot amputations, because inflammation should be easy to detect down there. the eventual goal is to have people wear a button that collects body temperature information and then can detect inflammation. on doing a little research, the biggest increase in foot amputations in the recent years have been amongst younger and middle age adults who lack insurance and do very little about their diabetes. Nonetheless, there are about 230 diabetes amputations each day, about 85% in the foot.

virutal caregiving. Imagine a world where your loved one lives independently at home and your mobile device notifies you when something isn’t right or everything is just right - with no buttons to push or calls to initiate. Monitor activities that you and your loved one are most concerned about – a declining cognitive state, night time safety, wandering, or the home environment itself. All of this is done seamlessly and invisibly - no cameras, no microphones, no wearables, and nothing to charge.
